A game I made while learning JavaScript.This project containing 3 files
1.index.html
2.style.css
3.App.js

This is a puzzle game.The tiles collectively form a complete image. These images can be found in the resources folder. I used an online image cutting tool to cut the images into 9 exact parts (3x3).

When index.html loads, the code loads the puzzle. When player move tile the number of turns will increase by 1. Their is also a restart button to restart the game.
